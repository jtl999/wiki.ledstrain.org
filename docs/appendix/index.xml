This kind of illumination is the one present on 100% of screens (excluding eInk screens). See Frontlight to know about the alternative illumination.
Blue light One of the colours protected off from a screen with backlight, which has a spectrum of light that affects us in a different way than the other colours. In the last years it started to become a concern for people who work all day with a computer and appeared special glasses to block it, as it stimulates some brain activity after a few hours of use, provoking difficulty to sleep, plus other effects.</description></item><item><title>Tests</title><link>https://wiki.ledstrain.org/docs/appendix/tests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.ledstrain.org/docs/appendix/tests/</guid><description>Dithering I have bought a capture card Seagull So the card arrived today, and I've spent the afternoon experimenting. Fortunately, getting it work wasn't too hard. The results so far are largely what I expected. For testing, I captured a second of uncompressed 8-bit quicktime uncompressed YUV using BlackMagic's software, of which five consecutive frames were analysed. The video was of the windows 10 desktop with default W10 wallpaper.</description></item></channel></rss>
